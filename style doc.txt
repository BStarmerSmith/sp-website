I want the website designed with one centeral screen and what changes as the page changes (navigation) is only the content with the framework
- Header (fixed to top (not fixed on mobile))
- content (restricted to space between header and footer)
- footer (fixed to bottom (not fixed on mobile))

# Header
Header Gradient
Header Text: White
Going horizontal

Then from the right side we should have the links to `Games`, `About us`, `Contact us`

On desktop Should show the `assets/sp-logo-header.png` (64x64) Followed by Suzy Parker Games on the left
On mobiles it should just show `assets/sp-logo-header.png` and the links should only appear on a drop down when you press a button 

# Footer
On the left
