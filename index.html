          Welcome to Suzy Parker Games
        </h2>
        <p class="text-s text-gray-600 mb-8 max-w-4xl mx-auto text-left">
          We make games that might ruin your evening, <i>in the most entertaining way possible.</i><br><br>
          At Suzy Parker Games, we design brain-twisting, laugh-inducing, occasionally friendship ending games for people who enjoy a challenge... or just enjoy watching their mates squirm.<br><br>
          
          Our games can be played solo on a train, in a pub with a few friends, or during a full blown games night with 20 slightly confused people and one very smug winner.
          They're fun. They're frustrating. They'll probably keep you up at 3am wondering, “Why can't I stop thinking about that one stupid question?”<br><br>

          <b>Blame Philip.</b> He’s our co-founder and lead question-writer. After a lengthy stay in hospital (don’t ask), he decided to funnel his frustration into puzzles designed to gently torment innocent players. <b>We tried to stop him. We failed.</b><br><br>

          Made by a bunch of creatives, techies and <i>one dangerously enthusiastic project manager</i>, Suzy Parker Games is here to bring you joy, chaos, and possibly a mild existential crisis.<br><br>

          If you’re a little bit weird, <b>you’ll feel right at home.</b>
